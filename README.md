# Rock, Paper, Scissors
## Introduction
This program is a standard game of rock paper scissors to be run in a terminal or command prompt.  Both the user and the computer make a selection, and the results are printed to the terminal.
## Installation
Click the green "clone or download" button, select "download ZIP", and save the ZIP file to your computer.  Locate and extract the rock-paper-scissors-master.zip file.  Copy and past RPS.py to the desired location on your computer.
## Operation
Run RPS.py.  The game will prompt the user for a username which will be saved for one match.  After receiving the name, the game will ask the user whether they are familiar with the rules of Rock Paper Scissors or not.  If they are, the game continues, if not, instructions are printed to the screen before the game begins.  During the game, a selection is received from the user, and a random number generator (RNG) is used to make a random selection for the computer.  The two selections are then compared, and the program prints a message with the results of the match.  The user is then given the option to play again or not.  If "play again" is chosen, the program will reset and restart from the begining.
